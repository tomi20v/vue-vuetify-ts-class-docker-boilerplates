# vue-vuetify-ts-class-docker-boilerplates

# Vue3 + Vuetify3 + typescript + class components boilerplates 

Based on the original Vuetify 3 scaffold, various flavors

## The basic stack

- vue 3 - to migrate from 2
- vite - because it's fast
- vuetify 3 - some our projects use it
- vue-facing-decorator - because class syntax saved from inherently spaghetti code
- vite-plugin-vue-facing-decorator-hmr - to fix HMR with vue-facing-decorator
- docker-compose.yml - to easily spin up your container

## Flavors

### with vuex - because separating actions from mutations is important

- vuex 4
- vuex-facing-decorator

### with storybook (planned)

- vuex 4
- vuex-facing-decorator
- storybook 8

## ðŸ’¿ Install

- clone/fork
- checkout the branch of the flavour
- start up the container ```docker-compose up```

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for development.
